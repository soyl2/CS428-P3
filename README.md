# CS428-P3

### INTRO
This is my third project for CS428: Augmented and Virtual Reality course at UIC. We decorated the atrium of the as-of-yet unbuilt CDRLC building in VR, with a theme of our choosing. In my case, I chose to go with a vaporwave theme for the atrium.

###### REQUIREMENTS:
- [Unity Editor 2021.3.6f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [Vuforia 10.9](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/SDK)
- A Quest headset and a way to plug it in to your machine

### DISCUSSION

This is a really useful tool to be able to visualize something before it is built in full. While it was fun for this project to make something completely unrealistic and decorate according to a theme rather than what would be practical, it is also very possible to just do something "boring" and more fitting for the kind of project this building will end up becoming.

Sometimes it can be pretty difficult to visualize how a finished product will look, and especially in cases such as buildings, it would take a lot of time and resources before you can actually preview your ideas in real life. At which point, you might realize that it did not end up looking like how you imagined it at all... but it is too late now, you've spent too much on the project! With VR, we can alleviate this by making a scale model of whatever we are building before having to commit to it. 

Not only that, but if any investors are involved (or you're just trying to convince your parents that orange walls will look totally amazing in your new room, you swear!) you can impress them by showing them your plans in a way thats a pretty close experience to what they would get from walking through the finished product. It's one thing to know that the pillars are going to be huge, it's another thing entirely to just be able to look up at it and feel the scale of it as it stands in front of you. A seasoned architect or interior designer might be able to predict with accuracy how their plans will look when finished, but someone commissioning said architect/designer does not have that expertise and has no choice but to trust their vision. It's not uncommon that they'll end up disappointed in the result because they misunderstood what was being told to them or just could not picture the final product but the person selling it to them said it would be cool. If you can preview what you'll get before committing to it in VR, then this should not be as much of an issue.

It is also a good way to test whether a layout is actually practical. Just walking through a space can give you a different perspective on what might look better or be more useful, and you can make those changes in your plan accordingly and with minimal cost (if any at all). It is a far greater problem to fix something that was built wrong than to make it correctly in the first place. 

Regular people can benefit from this just as much as someone building something for a university. It is so much easier to move a couch or some other large furniture around in VR than to do so in real life, not to mention a lot safer for your back. Why not test out some layouts for your new living room before rearranging the furniture around? Or in fact, why not test it out before you buy the house to see if you can work with it? VR can help you visualize how big that bookshelf you ordered from IKEA will really look in your apartment, and you don't even have to assemble it first. Thinking about renovating your kitchen? Maybe test whether an open plan kitchen is something you would actually like in your space before tearing that wall down. It's really incredibly convenient for anyone.
